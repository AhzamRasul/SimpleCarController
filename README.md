# Simple Car Controller

![Screenshot 2023-07-05 174536](https://github.com/AhzamRasul/SimpleCarController/assets/50517265/f00cb758-8382-4524-b5e4-23a47bb48038)

This repository contains a simple car controller for Unity 2021.3.8f1, designed for 3D games using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). The car controller utilizes the free "Arcade Car" package obtained from the Unity Asset Store.

## Getting Started

To use the Simple Car Controller, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Unity project using the 3D Sample Scene template with URP enabled.
2. Import the "Arcade Car" package from the Unity Asset Store into your project.
3. Create a plane in your scene to serve as the car's movement area.
4. Open the "Prefab" folder in your project after importing the "Arcade Car" package.
5. Drag the desired car asset from the "Prefab" folder into your scene.
6. Go to Edit > Rendering > Material and convert the selected built-in material to URP.
7. Break the prefab connection of the car asset and give it a new name.
8. Add a Rigidbody and Box Collider component to the root GameObject of the car. Adjust the size of the Box Collider as needed.
9. Create an empty GameObject named "Wheel Collider" and add Wheel Colliders to each of the car's wheels. Place the Wheel Collider GameObject in the correct position relative to the wheels.
10. Create two new scripts: "CarController" (to be added to the car) and "CameraFollow" (to be added to the camera).
11. Attach the "CarController" script to the car GameObject and the "CameraFollow" script to the camera.
12. Customize the car's behaviour and camera settings in the corresponding scripts, if desired.

## Usage

The Simple Car Controller provides basic car movement and control for your Unity game. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to steer the car and accelerate or decelerate. Use a spacebar for  hard braking. The camera will follow the car's movement, providing a dynamic perspective.

Feel free to modify the provided scripts and experiment with different settings to suit your specific project requirements. The car controller is a starting point that can be expanded upon to create more complex and realistic driving experiences.
